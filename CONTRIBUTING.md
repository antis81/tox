# Contributing to Tox

We'd love for you to contribute to our source code and to make Tox even better
than it is today! Here are the guidelines we'd like you to follow:

- [Issues and Bugs](#found-an-issue)
- [Coding Rules](#coding-rules)
- [Commit Guidelines](#git-commit-guidelines)
- [Submission Guidelines](#submission-guidelines)

## Must read

- Use **[commit message format](#commit-message-format)**.
- Keep the title **short** and provide a **clear** description about what your
  pull request does.
- Keep your git commit history **clean** and **precise**. Commits like
  `xxx fixup` should not appear.
- If your commit fixes a reported issue (for example #4134), add the following
  message to the commit `Fixes #4134.`.

## Found an Issue?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can
help us by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better,
you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

## Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as
you are working:

- All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more tests.
  - Whenever possible, use property-based testing in addition to example-based
    testing. [QuickCheck](https://github.com/BurntSushi/quickcheck) helps with that.
- All functions **must be documented**, *especially* APIs.
- Preferably wrap all the code at **80 characters**, or max 100 if you have to.
  This is not a *hard* rule - just keep it sane.
- Spaces, 4 of them for an indent level, no tabs.

*This section needs to be improved - if you're interested in doing that, please do.*

## Git Commit Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.
This leads to **more readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking
through the **project history**.  But also, we use the git commit messages to
**generate the Tox change log** using [clog-cli](https://github.com/clog-tool/clog-cli).

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The
header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 72 characters! This allows the
message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

Note that [`verify-commit-messages.sh`](/scripts/verify-commit-messages.sh) is
used to check conformance of commits in the pull request to commit message
format.

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:`,
followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say:
`This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space,
  formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such
  as documentation generation

### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `$location`,
`$browser`, `$compile`, `$rootScope`, `ngHref`, `ngClick`, `ngView`, etc...

### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not
"changed" nor "changes". The body should include the motivation for the change
and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also
the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space
or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

## Submission Guidelines

### Submitting a Pull Request

Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

- Search [GitHub][github-prs] for an open or closed Pull Request that relates to
  your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
- Make your changes in a new git branch:

     ```shell
     git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
     ```

- Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.
- Run the tests: `cargo test`, and ensure that all of them pass.
- Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our
  [commit message conventions](#commit-message-format). Adherence is required
  because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.

     ```shell
     git commit -a
     ```

  Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add"
  and "rm" edited files.

- Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```

- In GitHub, send a pull request to `zetok:master`.
- If we suggest changes then:
  - Make the required updates.
  - Re-run `cargo test` to ensure test are still passing.
  - Commit your changes to your branch (e.g. `my-fix-branch`).
  - Push the changes to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request).

If the PR gets too outdated we may ask you to rebase and force push to update
the PR:

```shell
git rebase master -i
git push origin my-fix-branch -f
```

*WARNING. Squashing or reverting commits and forced push thereafter may remove
GitHub comments on code that were previously made by you and others in your commits.*

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull
the changes from the main (upstream) repository:

- Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your
  local shell as follows:

    ```shell
    git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
    ```

- Check out the master branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout master -f
    ```

- Delete the local branch:

    ```shell
    git branch -D my-fix-branch
    ```

- Update your master with the latest upstream version:

    ```shell
    git pull --ff upstream master
    ```
